# Implement a Queue using two Stacks.
The challenge asks to, "implement a Queue using two Stacks."

## Challenge
The challenge is to have two stacks emulate the behavior of a queue. The most difficult has to be the visual of it. And conceptualizing the behavior with the use of stacks. Having the stacks be the properties of the queue class seems to make the most sense.

## Solution
