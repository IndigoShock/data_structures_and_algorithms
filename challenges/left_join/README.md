# Left Join
Implement a simplified LEFT JOIN for 2 Hashmaps.

## Challenge
The challenge is to join the two hashmaps together. If the key's match in both hashmaps, then join. If not, then add a value of Null. The visual here is what is most important.
The synonyms will be input into a 2D array first since this is what will be returned. In the 3rd indices of each row, the value will change based on the corresponding key. If the key in the antonym hashmap is matched with the synonym's hashmap, then append it to the row. If not, append the value of NULL to the 3rd indices.
Return the 2D array.
