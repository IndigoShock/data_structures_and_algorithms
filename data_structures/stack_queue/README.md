# Stacks and Queues

## Implementation

### Stacks
For stacks, the nodes sit on top. The functionality of it is only two methods: pushing and popping. If pushed, a node goes into the top position. If popped, the top node comes out. Only one way in and one way out. First in, first out. The Peek method is available to see the top node's value.

### Queues
For queues, the nodes conceptually sit in a line. The functionality rests on two methods: queueing and dequeueing. If queued, the node goes into the front. If dequeued, a node comes out from the rear. First in, last out. The Peek method is available to see the first node's value.

## What type of uses you would use this for (provide 2 examples)
a. Calculators using reverse Polish notation
b. Dynamic Memory Allocation
