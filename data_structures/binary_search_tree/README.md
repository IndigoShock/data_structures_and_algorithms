# Trees

## Implementation
- For Binary Tree, the root node sits on the top. The functionality of it is to traverse through and determine whether the value of the root element is larger or greater than the new node element. And it can be traversed depth-first or breadth-first. The binary tree can be unordered values.

- For Binary Search Trees, the root node also sits on top. The functionality is to search and add elements to it based on the Binary tree functionality. If the new node element is greater than the root node, value continues to right until it is less than the root node and continues until a null element is found and a null exception is thrown.

## Two examples
1. For a Binary Search Tree, "Used in many search applications where data is constantly entering/leaving, such as the map and set objects in many languages"
2. For a Binary Tree, "Used in almost every 3D video game to determine what objects need to be rendered."
