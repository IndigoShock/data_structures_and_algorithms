# Linked Lists

## Implementation
Head starts at beginning. Current is the current value, which starts at the Head. The _next references the node after the current. We have demonstrated the nodes linked together by value and reference values. The last node will have a reference value of null. The methods we have are to insert, add before, add after and iterating through. The str and repr methods will show what values and references are have for each node.

## What type of uses you would use this for (provide 2 examples)
a. Train and train stops
b. Elevator and elevator floors
