# Graphs

## Implementation
Graph is a data structure of nodes. Which can either be connected throughout or on an 'island'. An island means it is a contained cluster of nodes but not connected to another cluster.
Each node could be standalone or connected to another node, including itself. If the node is connected to another, they have an Edge together and are Neighbors. And the node can be connected to any number of neighbors, not just one. The size can be any number as well except 0.
It's also important to note the graph can be 'weighted.' Or the connecting edge can have a value. This value can vary.
